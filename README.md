# Banking_Subscription_Prediction

The aim of this project is to see whether we can predict whether a client subscribed to a term deposit after a direct marking campaign from a Portugese bank. 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, based on phone calls (Moro, Cortez, and Rita 2014).

The goal of the campaigns were to get the clients to subscribe to a term deposit. There are 20 input variables and 1 binary output variable (y) that indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit with values ‘yes’,‘no’.

We try a few different classification methods, including: 
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks.
